<h3 align="left">About me.</h3>

<h4 align="center">Chilango de nacimiento, choyero y gringo de corazon</h4>
<div class="tablecolor">
<p align="justify" align="center">I was born in Mexico City in Magdanela de Contreras “Chilango” at the age of one I moved to Cabo San Lucas “Choyero” where spend most of my childhood until I was 13 years old. Then I moved to San Diego “Gringo” and after 12 years I am back to place that see me born. Due to proximity of my childhood to sea I grew loving aquatic activities. I am a very active person and love sports. When I was seven years old I was diagnosed with diabetes type 1 and that event sparked a curiosity for the human body which lead for a love of life and its processes. Because of that I studied Human Biology and graduated from UCSD. I decided to join Hola Code because I truly believe that programming is the future, its applications and impact are endless in the digital era we as humanity are entering and personally very interested in the correlation that can exist between health.</p>
